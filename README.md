# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website I developed for my friend Abdul Haseeb. The website showcases Abdul Haseeb's work and is designed to highlight his skills and projects.

## Demo

## Contributions

- **UI/UX and Design**: Handled by Abdul Haseeb.
- **Coding**: Developed by me, focusing on implementing the design and functionality.

## Learning Experience
